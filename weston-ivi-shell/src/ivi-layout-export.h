/**
 * The ivi-layout library supports API set of controlling properties of
 * surface and layer which groups surfaces. An unique ID whose type is integer
 * is required to create surface and layer. With the unique ID, surface and
 * layer are identified to control them. The API set consists of APIs to control
 * properties of surface and layers about followings,
 * - visibility.
 * - opacity.
 * - clipping (x,y,width,height).
 * - position and size of it to be displayed.
 * - orientation per 90 degree.
 * - add or remove surfaces to a layer.
 * - order of surfaces/layers in layer/screen to be displayed.
 * - commit to apply property changes.
 * - notifications of property change.
 *
 * Management of surfaces and layers grouping these surfaces are common
 * way in In-Vehicle Infotainment system, which integrate several domains
 * in one system. A layer is allocated to a domain in order to control
 * application surfaces grouped to the layer all together.
 *
 * This API and ABI follow following specifications.
